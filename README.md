## About
### Intro
Deciding which ski resort to go to is hard with factors to consider like epic snowfall, and if the wind and chill will be worth it. This app is for all skiers, snowboarders, and powder chasers. Ski Meow helps you choose the ski resort with the most ideal conditions for a great powder day! Let's Ski Meow!

Ski Meow is published [here](https://autumn-martin.github.io/ski_meow/).

### Background
[Ski Meow](https://autumn-martin.github.io/ski_meow/) is a JavaScript single page app that has been integrated with my backend, PowderKeg. PowderKeg is an API which consumes weather data from [DarkSky](https://darksky.net/dev) and [World Weather Online](https://www.worldweatheronline.com/developer/api/ski-weather-api.aspx). PowderKeg is deployed [here](https://powderkeg.herokuapp.com/), and has an open source repository [here](https://github.com/Autumn-Martin/powderkeg). PowderKeg also consumes data from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/developers), which Ski Meow uses to feature a random image for the background.
